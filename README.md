Command Line Paint Bucket
======

Building off the *Grid* class built for **Grid It!** this is another command line game that was made as part of an assignment.
Instead of posing a challenge though, this time all you have to do is supply a shape - this can be plotted by you using the 
on screen *Grid* (a painstaking exercise) or you can have the program read in the coordinates from a text file (recommended).
Once you are done, just select an initial point on the *Grid* and watch as the program fills in the plotted shape - similar 
to the *Bucket* tool found in many graphics programs.

The assignment can be found [here](https://www.cs.drexel.edu/~mcs172/Sp14/assignments/HW5/index.html).
